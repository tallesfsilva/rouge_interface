Acquisition of a foreign language through watching subtitled programs The contribution of subtitled movies and television programs to the learning of foreign languages seems predictable for several reasons: Subtitled television programs seem to constitute a rich context for foreign language acquisition.

Research on foreign language acquisition through watching subtitled programs For a long time, research on the use of subtitled programs in foreign language learning was focused on the effect of captioning.

An important question arose: how much of a foreign language children must know before they are capable of acquiring elements of this language through watching subtitled movies and television programs? The European Survey on Language Competences measured the foreign language proficiency of approximately 54 000 secondary education students across 16 educational systems/countries.

A multivariate analysis aiming at explaining school internal and external factors of language learning shows that there is a positive relationship between foreign language proficiency and the exposure of students to foreign languages through traditional and new media.
